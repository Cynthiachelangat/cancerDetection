    "# **Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. If the spread is not controlled, it can result in death. There are many types of cancer, including breast cancer, lung cancer, skin cancer, and others. Early detection of cancer significantly increases the chances of successful treatment and survival. Modern medical research emphasizes the use of advanced technologies, such as machine learning, to aid in the early detection and diagnosis of cancer.\n",

    "## **Business Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Early and accurate detection of cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes and survival rates. Traditional diagnostic methods, while effective, can be time-consuming and subject to human error. There is a need for an automated, reliable system that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing cancer early and accurately, reducing the rate of false negatives and false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can detect whether a patient has cancer based on diagnostic data. This model aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing a reliable tool for early cancer detection, thereby improving patient outcomes through timely and accurate diagnosis."
